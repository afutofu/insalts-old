# InSalts - A website for salty people

A simple project to practice full stack web development using :

- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- AJAX
- Node.js
- Mongodb

This project would not have been possible had I not taken Colt Steele's 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' which has primarily taught me all the above knowledge, as well as 'The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp' by the same creator for solidifying my understanding on AJAX and advancing my competency with CSS and JS.

I thank my friend for giving the initial spark of the concept of this website, "Reddit for insults".
