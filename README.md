# InSalts - A website for salty people

Simple project to practice full stack web development using :

- jQuery
- Bootstrap
- Node.js
- Mongodb

This project would not have been possible had I not taken Colt Steele's 'The Web Developer Bootcamp' which has primarily taught me all the above knowledge
